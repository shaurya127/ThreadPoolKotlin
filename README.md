# Android Threading and Asynchronous Operations Example
# This Android application demonstrates various ways to handle asynchronous operations using threads, executors, and coroutines. It showcases how to perform network operations, heavy computations, and file I/O without blocking the UI thread, ensuring smooth user interaction.

Features
Load Image: Downloads images asynchronously using different threading models.
Simulate Task Execution: Executes multiple tasks in the background using a fixed thread pool.
Block UI: Demonstrates the impact of improperly blocking the UI thread and correctly handling long-running operations.
Perform Heavy Computation: Simulates a heavy computational task to demonstrate background processing.
Network Operations: Simulates a network call to demonstrate asynchronous API requests.
File I/O Operations: Demonstrates file reading on a background thread to avoid UI freezing.
Components
MainActivity: The main activity that initializes and sets up the UI and event handlers.
ImageView: Displays images loaded from the internet.
Buttons: Trigger different asynchronous operations.
TextView: Displays status and results of operations.
Setup
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shaurya127/ThreadPoolKotlin
Open Project in Android Studio:
Open Android Studio.
Click on 'Open an existing Android Studio project'.
Navigate to the cloned directory.
Select the project and open it.
Run the Application:
Ensure you have an Android emulator set up or a physical Android device connected.
Click on the 'Run' button in Android Studio toolbar.
Select your device/emulator and wait for the app to launch.
Usage
Load Images: Click on the respective buttons ('Load with Thread', 'Load with Executor', 'Load with Coroutine') to load images from predefined URLs.
Start Background Tasks: Click on 'Start Tasks' to execute multiple tasks using an executor.
Block UI: Click on 'Block UI' to see how the UI behaves when the main thread is blocked.
Simulate Long Operation: Click on 'Simulate Long Operation' to run a non-blocking background operation that updates the UI periodically.
Perform Heavy Computation: Click on 'Block By Heavy Computation' to simulate a heavy computation in the background.
Architecture
This application uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

Model: Handles the data logic.
View: UI components like buttons and text views.
Controller: Activity that binds the data with the views using event handlers and background tasks.
Libraries
Coroutines: For asynchronous and non-blocking operations.
Android SDK: Standard UI and networking libraries.
